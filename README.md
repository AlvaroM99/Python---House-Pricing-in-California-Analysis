# Python - House Pricing in California: Data Analysis with Pandas

## Overview



## Dataset



## Guiding Variables over the Sale Price

The main quest of this work is to identify which variables are the most influential over the house price. For this purpose we must propose the parameters that we think have the greatest impact over our dependent variable 'SalePrice' and test them during the data analysis.

Spatial variables
- 'TotalBsmtSF': Area of the basement
- 'GrLivArea': Total area of living space in the house

Construction variables
- 'OverallQual': Overall quality of the construction materials and the final design of the house
- 'YearBuilt': Year in which the house was built



## Data Analysis

As the tool used for this exploratory data analysis has been the Jupyter Notebook; the documentation has been done throughout the notebook, alongside the calculations and graphs. Like that we take advantage of the key feature of Jupyter Notebooks, gathering all the tasks of the data analysis (calculations, visualization, and documentation) in a single file. So please head to House Pricing in California_Data Analysis with Pandas.ipynb.
